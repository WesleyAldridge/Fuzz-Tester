# Mutation-based Fuzz Tester/Fuzzer

Language: C

Description:
Fuzz testing is a way of discovering security vulnerabilities in any code that processes potentially malicious input. A mutation-based fuzzer takes a valid input for a target program and works by creating random mutations/changes to the input to generate test cases to see how the target program responds to various invalid entries to test for security vulnerabilities.
